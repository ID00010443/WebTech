# Description

A log in log out page for a food company. The main functionality of the page is to make sure that the guest logs in and outs and sees the description of the file with corresponding photos. Nothing complicated was used to create this file- most importantly, there was no cheating at all- all the knowledge acquired during the lessons was implemented by heart, without peaking.
